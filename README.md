# Socket.IO .NET Client Implementation

## A simple implementation of Socket.IO client using .NET as a POC for a case I'm working on.

- ## Quick Start

  - To install dependencies (packages):

    Start by <i>(Build Project)</i> from <b>Visual Studio</b>'s Object Browser.

  - Run the project.

  - Set the `server-url` and press `Connect to Server`.

- ## Node.js (Server & Client)

  An additional implementation of the <b>Socket.IO Client</b> in addition to the basic implementation of the <b>Socket.IO Server</b> could be found on [<b>Socket.IO Node.js Server & Client</b>](https://github.com/FawzyMokhtar/socket.io).
